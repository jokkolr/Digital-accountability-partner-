# Digital Accountability Partner

This is a simple web app I built to help people work on improving their lives by **breaking bad habits and building good ones**.  
It’s designed to be easy to use, mobile-friendly, and motivating for anyone who wants to make small daily progress.

## What the App Does
- Lets users **log in with their name** and choose a habit to focus on:
  - Quit Drugs  
  - Quit Porn  
  - Stop Procrastination  
  - Build Fitness  
- Tracks a **daily streak** showing how many days you’ve stayed consistent.
  - The streak goes up automatically each day you visit.  
  - If you miss a day, it resets to Day 1 (or you can reset it yourself).  
- Offers **motivational tips** you can view any time for encouragement.  
- Plays a **soft sound and pop-up message** when your streak increases to keep you motivated.  
- Saves your progress in your browser so it doesn’t disappear when you close the page.  

## Why I Built It
I wanted to create something **practical and lightweight** that anyone can use directly from their phone or computer without needing to sign up with an email or download anything.  
It’s also part of my portfolio as I work toward getting **remote IT and web development jobs**.

## How to Use
1. Open the site (live demo link will be here once deployed).  
2. Enter your name and select a habit focus.  
3. The dashboard will track your streak, show tips, and keep you motivated.  
4. Visit once a day to keep your streak alive!

## Live Demo
